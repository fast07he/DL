#clustering:It is grouping of data object based on their feature,it is 
unsuperred machine learning technique 
#k-means clustering:is unsuperwised machine learning clustering algorithm
it is a simplest algorithm in which dataset is partitioned into k cluster
it is centroid based method in which cluster are associated with centroid 

#Advantages:1.simple to implement 2.scale to large dataset
#Disadvantages:1.choosing K-manually 2.dependent on initial values

#Working of K-Means Algorithm
We can understand the working of K-Means clustering algorithm with the help of following steps −
Step 1 − First, we need to specify the number of clusters, K, need to be generated by this algorithm.
Step 2 − Next, randomly select K data points and assign each data point to a cluster. In simple words, 
classify the data based on the number of data points.
Step 3 − Now it will compute the cluster centroids.
Step 4 − Next, keep iterating the following until we find optimal centroid which is the assignment of 
data points to the clusters that are not changing any more −
